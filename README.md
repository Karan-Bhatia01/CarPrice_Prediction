1. data/ (Data Handling)
Store your datasets here.
raw/: Place the original dataset files here (CSV, JSON, etc.).
processed/: Store cleaned, feature-engineered, and transformed datasets.
✅ Where to work?
Use notebooks/ to explore data.
Write data cleaning scripts in src/data_preprocessing.py.
2. notebooks/ (Exploratory Data Analysis)
Store Jupyter notebooks for EDA, visualization, and experiments.
Test feature selection, correlations, and initial ML models.
✅ Where to work?
Work inside Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb).
Save important preprocessing steps for src/data_preprocessing.py.
3. src/ (Main Project Code)
data_preprocessing.py: Clean the data, handle missing values, and engineer features.
model_training.py: Train your ML model, save results in models/.
inference.py: Load the trained model and make predictions.
✅ Where to work?
Write Python scripts here for data processing and model training.
Train models and save them inside models/.
4. models/ (Trained Models)
Store trained models here (.pkl or .h5).
Helps in version control and reusability.
✅ Where to work?
Save models from model_training.py inside this folder.
Load models from inference.py for predictions.
5. app.py (API Deployment)
This is the entry point for deploying your model as an API.
Use Flask or FastAPI to create an endpoint for predictions.
✅ Where to work?
Load the trained model from models/.
Write API routes in app.py to accept requests and return predictions.
6. requirements.txt (Dependencies)
List all required Python libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, Flask, etc.).
Helps in setting up a virtual environment for deployment.
✅ Where to work?
Run pip freeze > requirements.txt to update it after installing dependencies.
Use pip install -r requirements.txt on a new system to install dependencies.
7. README.md (Documentation)
Explain how to run the project, train models, and use the API.
✅ Where to work?
Add installation steps, dataset description, and API usage guide.
8. setup.py (Packaging)
If you want to package your code as a Python module, write the setup script.
✅ Where to work?
If needed, define dependencies and installable modules here.
