# 🚗 Car Price Prediction System
## 📌 Overview
The **Car Price Prediction System** is a machine learning project designed to predict car prices based on various features such as mileage, engine capacity, brand, and model. It uses **regression techniques** and **feature engineering** to provide accurate price estimations, helping users make informed buying or selling decisions.

## 🚀 Features
- 📊 **Accurate Predictions (90%)** – Uses advanced regression models.
- ⚡ **Real-Time Estimations** – Get instant car price predictions.
- 🎨 **User-Friendly Web App** – Built using **Flask/Streamlit**.
- 📈 **Feature Engineering** – Optimized dataset for high performance.
- 🌍 **Scalable** – Ready for deployment on cloud services.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍
- **Libraries & Frameworks:**
  - Pandas, NumPy – Data Processing
  - Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow – Machine Learning
  - Regression Models – Prediction Algorithms
  - Flask, Streamlit – Web Application
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data Visualization
